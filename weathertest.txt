Description
-----------

Create a simple React + Redux app that allows a user to enter a location to see the weather forecast for that location.

Your app should have an input which allows the user to enter a town/city (e.g London).

Upon the user submitting the input, your app will connect to a weather API (e.g https://www.openweathermap.org/api ), retrieve the forecast for that city and store it in the Redux store.

The user will be shown the following information from the data for each of the next 5 days:

[Day]

e.g Monday

[min temp]

e.g 23°C/73°F

[max temp]

e.g 23°C/73°F

[conditions]

i.e clear sky or light snow

[wind]

e.g 27kmh/17mph WNW

The user should then be able to select a day interactively to drill-down and see a more detailed forecast for that day (e.g. 3-hourly data).
